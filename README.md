The vertebral Column or spine is a sequence of bones from the neck to the tail owned by the vertebrates. 
The function of the spine is to protect the spinal nerves. 
The spine may experience malfunction if it is caused by abnormalities and diseases such as Disk Hernia and Spondylolisthesis. 
Based on the problem then it takes a system that can recognize or identify the disease Disk Hernia and Spondylolisthesis that attack the spine. 
So that it can be diagnosed with early spinal diseases. In building this system using C 5.0 algorithm. 
This research uses 310 data from the UCI machine Learning, where there are three classification classes of Normal, Hernia disks, and Spondylolisthesis. 
The results showed that the C 5.0 algorithm was able to identify with accuracy of 79%. 
Then the resulting decision tree C 5.0 algorithm is maximized by using AdaBoost algorithm, so the accuracy increases to 83%.

This script has not been maximized with the AdaBoost algorithm.
